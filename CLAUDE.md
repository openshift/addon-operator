I've analyzed the addon-operator codebase and created a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file. The analysis revealed this is a sophisticated Kubernetes operator for managing OpenShift addons with the following key characteristics:

## Key Findings:

**Architecture**: Go-based Kubernetes operator using controller-runtime with three main CRDs (Addon, AddonInstance, AddonOperator) and support for both OLM and Package Operator installation methods.

**Build System**: Uses Mage for build automation wrapped by Make, with extensive containerized tooling via Boilerplate for consistency with CI/CD.

**Development Workflow**: Comprehensive local development setup with Kind clusters, OLM integration, and both unit and integration testing capabilities.

**Structure**: Well-organized with clear separation between API definitions, controllers, internal packages, and comprehensive testing.

The CLAUDE.md file I've prepared includes:
- Repository overview and core architecture
- Complete development command reference  
- Key environment variables and configuration
- Project structure explanation
- Build system details
- Testing approach

This will help future Claude Code instances quickly understand how to work effectively with this codebase for development, testing, and debugging tasks.
