        description: "OperatorPKI is a simple certificate authority. It is not intended
          for external use - rather, it is internal to the network operator. The CNO
          creates a CA and a certificate signed by that CA. The certificate has both
          ClientAuth and ServerAuth extended usages enabled. \n  More specifically,
          given an OperatorPKI with <name>, the CNO will manage: - A Secret called
          <name>-ca with two data keys:   - tls.key - the private key   - tls.crt
          - the CA certificate - A ConfigMap called <name>-ca with a single data key:
          \  - cabundle.crt - the CA certificate(s) - A Secret called <name>-cert
          with two data keys:   - tls.key - the private key   - tls.crt - the certificate,
          signed by the CA \n The CA certificate will have a validity of 10 years,
          rotated after 9. The target certificate will have a validity of 6 months,
          rotated after 3 \n The CA certificate will have a CommonName of \"<namespace>_<name>-ca@<timestamp>\",
          where <timestamp> is the last rotation time."
