        description: EgressNetworkPolicy describes the current egress network policy
          for a Namespace. When using the 'redhat/openshift-ovs-multitenant' network
          plugin, traffic from a pod to an IP address outside the cluster will be
          checked against each EgressNetworkPolicyRule in the pod's namespace's EgressNetworkPolicy,
          in order. If no rule matches (or no EgressNetworkPolicy is present) then
          the traffic will be allowed by default.
