# Integration Tests

This folder contains the integration tests and their utilities of the project.

These tests here are primarily used to test the Addon Operator itself and it's interaction with Kubernetes/OpenShift and OLM.

Previously these tests where named `e2e`-tests, but we choose to rename them, because the real end to end tests are done with osde2e and OCM.
